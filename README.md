# SecureBERT

[SecureBERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.02685) is a domain-specific language model to represent cybersecurity textual data which is trained on a large amount of in-domain text crawled from online resources.

## SecureBERT can be used as the base model for any downstream task including semantic analysis, text classification, NER, Seq-to-Seq, QA, etc.
* SecureBERT has demonstrated significantly higher performance in predicting masked words within the text when compared to existing models like RoBERTa (base and large), SciBERT, and SecBERT.
* SecureBERT has also demonstrated promising performance in preserving general English language understanding (representation).

# How to use SecureBERT
SecureBERT has been uploaded to [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/ehsanaghaei/SecureBERT) framework. You may use the code below

```python
from transformers import RobertaTokenizer, RobertaModel
import torch

tokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained("ehsanaghaei/SecureBERT")
model = RobertaModel.from_pretrained("ehsanaghaei/SecureBERT")

inputs = tokenizer("This is SecureBERT!", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)

last_hidden_states = outputs.last_hidden_state

```

Or just clone the repo:

```bash
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/ehsanaghaei/SecureBERT
# if you want to clone without large files â€“ just their pointers
# prepend your git clone with the following env var:
GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1
```

## Fill Mask
SecureBERT has been trained on MLM. Use the code below to predict the masked word within the given sentences:

```python
#!pip install transformers
#!pip install torch
#!pip install tokenizers

import torch
import transformers
from transformers import RobertaTokenizer, RobertaTokenizerFast

tokenizer = RobertaTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("ehsanaghaei/SecureBERT")
model = transformers.RobertaForMaskedLM.from_pretrained("ehsanaghaei/SecureBERT")

def predict_mask(sent, tokenizer, model, topk =10, print_results = True):
    token_ids = tokenizer.encode(sent, return_tensors='pt')
    masked_position = (token_ids.squeeze() == tokenizer.mask_token_id).nonzero()
    masked_pos = [mask.item() for mask in masked_position]
    words = []
    with torch.no_grad():
        output = model(token_ids)

    last_hidden_state = output[0].squeeze()

    list_of_list = []
    for index, mask_index in enumerate(masked_pos):
        mask_hidden_state = last_hidden_state[mask_index]
        idx = torch.topk(mask_hidden_state, k=topk, dim=0)[1]
        words = [tokenizer.decode(i.item()).strip() for i in idx]
        words = [w.replace(' ','') for w in words]
        list_of_list.append(words)
        if print_results:
            print("Mask ", "Predictions : ", words)

    best_guess = ""
    for j in list_of_list:
        best_guess = best_guess + "," + j[0]

    return words


while True:
    sent = input("Text here: \t")
    print("SecureBERT: ")
    predict_mask(sent, tokenizer, model)
     
    print("===========================\n")
```

### Sample results:
